#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwd9f8ZIUaU&t=2s>
#### Description:

Welcome to Tasky, a powerful task management application designed specifically for developers!

The app.py file contains all the validation logic and the server-side. Inside the templates folder are all of the html files. The index2.html contains the homepage template, then the other templates have very explicit names indicating their function.
Meanwhile in the static folder you can find the images used in the web app, as well as the favicon.
In instance folder there is the database which I will not upload for security reasons as well as the flask secret key and the recaptcha key.
Talking about design, it was the most difficult and challenging part for me. The home page was redesign the last day because I did not like it. Then the card display for the projects was difficult to get, because i wnated them to be like in a computer or IDE kind of box.
Finally the delete and edit functions were pretty tricky too, because I had to ensure that the projects and tasks were deleted from the database as well as edited in the case the user want to edit them.
